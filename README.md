# Facture
Facturation
The program issues an invoice for a customer of a car rental company.

When the program runs, you have a catalog of the company's fleet of vehicles and the program asks you to choose the start 
and end dates of the rental and the category of the vehicle.

Once the three fields have been filled in, the program calculates the amount of the invoice and the bonus points that you have 
according to your choice.

The program is made up of two classes:

1. The Billing class which represents the class where I store the catalog data
2. The program class which contains the main function of calculating the invoice and points
